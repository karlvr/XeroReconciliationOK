XeroReconciliationOK
====================

A Safari browser extension to automatically click OK buttons for rule matches in Xero bank reconciliations.

Installation
------------
Install the extension in Safari by downloading the `XeroReconciliationOK.safariextz` file and opening it.
You can uninstall it at any time by going to the Preferences in Safari, to the Extensions tab, 
find and click the *XeroReconciliationOK* extension and click the Uninstall button.

Once the extension is installed, go to your reconciliation page in Xero. Then click in the location bar
in Safari and add the following to the end of the URL:

`&pageSize=1337`

That will activate the extension and it will start automatically clicking OK buttons on rules. 
It should not click OK buttons on other types of matches, such as previous matches, or anything 
that you enter manually. It will periodically reload the page, and may go to the next page. Sometimes 
it might miss some pages, near the end of a big set, so just find the page where it hasn’t finished 
and repeat the activation step above.

Please watch it in action until you’re confident that it is behaving as you expect. You can stop it
at any time by closing your browser window. 

There is no undo! Except to go through your bank transactions choosing transactions and unreconciling them. 
So please be careful!

Obviously I accept no responsibility for the correct functioning of this extension, including where
it doesn’t behave in the way that I describe, so you use it at your own risk!

I’d love to hear how it works for you. I’ve personally used it to reconcile nearly 5000 rule-based 
transactions so far.
